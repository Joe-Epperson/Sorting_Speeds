# Sorting_Speeds
- Program designed to demonstrate the amount of time it takes for each of the 5 main sorting algorithms to finish sorting three different randomly generated 1000 item arrays.
- When talking about time, for the purposes of this project time was described by the number of times values are switched, and the total number of switches would be output to display the amount of 'time' each process took.
- The purpose of this is to demonstrate which algorithm requires the least amount of switches
